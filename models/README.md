# Models
Here we create the various models for the CNN, taking inspirations by the
reference peaper and using some thricks like dropout, regularization and
differents gradient descend tecniques, we can do further more like modifing
the ANN architecture, using an autoencoder-based architecture or the
inception CNN network
